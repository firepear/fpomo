- Unices other than Mac OS use `mpg123 -q` as the default alert
  command, and use an included audio file as the default tone
- Config file is `~/.fpomorc`; an example is in `assets`

## Notes

- Mac OS
  - Sleep is an interrupt, so a laptop with aggressive sleep settings
    should not be used as an unattended timer
